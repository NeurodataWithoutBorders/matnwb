## Project overview
- MatNWB is a MATLAB interface for reading and writing Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) 2.x files and targets MATLAB R2019b or newer; surface APIs include nwbRead for loading and nwbExport for writing NWB files.
- This project is developed and maintained primarily in MATLAB. All scripts and functions with the .m extension are MATLAB code and are intended to be executed by the MATLAB interpreter.
- All MATLAB code is located in namespaces (folders prefixed by +) or the root directory
- MatNWB build nwb type classes from schemas using generateCore/generateExtension
- The main user-facing code is located in the +types namespace and the root directory

## Ignore
- do not use the namespaces folder if it exists
- do not use the the +contrib namespace if it exists
- Only consider schema files for the latest version in nwb-schema/

## Testing
- All tests are located in the +tests namespace
- nwbtest will run all tests
- when using nwbRead in tests, always use the ignorecache input to ensure classes are not generated
- Always create class based unittests based on matlab.unittest.TestCase

## Documentation style
- Documentation is built using sphinx
- Documentation instructions are located in docs/README.md
- Documentation should follow the Di√°taxis framework (https://diataxis.fr)
- Documentation source is located in docs/source/pages
- Reference documentation is built automatically from MATLAB function docstrings
- nwbRead provides an example docstring that renders well with rst/html
- tools/documentation/matnwb_generateRstFilesFromCode builds the structure for the reference documentation
- All tutorials are in the tutorials folder. .m versions of the .mlx files are located in tutorials/private/mcode

## Coding conventions
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for class and property names
- Always use argument blocks for function inputs, do NOT use inputParser

## Special instructions 
- Never edit class files under +types/+core. They are autogenerated and any manual changes will be overwritten.
- All class files are generated using code in the +file namespace
