Using Neurodata Extensions
==========================

The `NWB Specification Language <https://schema-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ 
can be used to create Neurodata Extensions (NDX), which extend the core NWB schemas 
with modified or entirely new data types. This is useful if you work with data 
that has specific metadata or data requirements not covered by the core NWB schemas. 
To learn more about extending NWB, see the :nwb_overview:`NWB Overview Documentation<extensions_tutorial/extensions_tutorial_home.html>`, 
and for a list of published extensions, visit the `Neurodata Extension Catalog <https://nwb-extensions.github.io>`_.

The following sections describe how to use extensions in MatNWB:
