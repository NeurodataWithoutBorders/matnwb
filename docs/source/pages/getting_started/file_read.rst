Reading NWB Files
=================

This section provides an overview of reading and exploring NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) files with MatNWB. It serves as a reference guide to the functions and data objects youâ€™ll interact with when working with NWB files. For detailed code examples and usage demonstrations, please refer to the :doc:`tutorials <../tutorials/index>`.

To read an NWB file, use the :func:`nwbRead` function:

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    nwb = nwbRead('path/to/file.nwb');

This command performs several important tasks behind the scenes:

1. **Opens the file** and reads its structure  
2. **Automatically generates MATLAB classes** needed to work with the data  
3. **Returns an NwbFile object** representing the entire file  

The returned `NwbFile` object is the primary access point for all the data in the file. In the :ref:`next section<matnwb-read-nwbfile-intro>`, we will examine the structure of this object in detail, covering how to explore it using standard MATLAB dot notation to access experimental metadata, raw recordings, processed data, and analysis results, as well as how to search for specific data types.

.. note::
    The :func:`nwbRead` function currently does not support reading NWB files stored in Zarr format.
